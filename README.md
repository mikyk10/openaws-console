# openaws-console
Automation tool for AWS console login.


## Overview
Assuming you are working on multiple AWS consoles simultaneously across different account IDs, you might open many browser windows for each account(s) and type lots of credentials or switch IAM role(s) back and forth. Either way, it's repetitive and cumbersome task. This tool can help you and ease your fatigue to open up AWS management console across multiple accounts without having you to enter ID/PW.
